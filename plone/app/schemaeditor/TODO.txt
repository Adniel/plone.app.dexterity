issues:
[ ] should make sure model isn't serialized multiple times

features:
[ ] docs
[ ] tests
[X] actually read/write values from schemata
[ ] handle default and missing values
[ ] handle vocabularies
[ ] handle widget selection
[ ] field ordering
[ ] adding fields
[ ] breadcrumbs niceties
[ ] write tests (don't use PloneTestCase)

design issues:
- integration w/ plone.dexterity vs. decoupling
- UI design for managing multiple fieldsets / schemata
- widget selection
- figure out what to do about vocabularies
- figure out what to do about Choice item types
