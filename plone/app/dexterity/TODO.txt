issues:
[ ] should make sure model isn't serialized multiple times
  - 

general:
[ ] docs
[ ] tests
[ ] types control panel

schema editor:
[X] actually read/write values from schemata
[X] handle default and missing values
[ ] handle vocabularies
[ ] handle widget selection
[ ] field ordering, fieldsets
[ ] adding fields
[ ] editing dexterity metadata like permissions
[ ] breadcrumbs niceties

design issues:
- UI design for managing multiple fieldsets / schemata
- widget selection
- figure out what to do about vocabularies
- figure out what to do about Choice item types
