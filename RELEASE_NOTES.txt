Release Notes
=============

Welcome to the first final release of the Dexterity content type system!

This release is compatible with Plone 3, 4, and 4.1, as long as you use
the correct set of version pins from good-py (see the installation guide).

Following this release, the Dexterity team will begin work on the Dexterity
2.0 series, which will only be compatible with Plone 4.1.  Maintenance
releases for the 1.0 series will still be made as necessary, for now.
